I have a unique symbol table for identifiers and constants,represented as a hash table
Position in ST ->  Token  
(7,0)  ->  Please input n-the number of integers you want to compute the sum of
(23,0)  ->  The sum of the given numbers is: 
(48,0)  ->  0
(48,1)  ->  input
(49,0)  ->  1
(85,0)  ->  sum
(105,0)  ->  i
(110,0)  ->  n
